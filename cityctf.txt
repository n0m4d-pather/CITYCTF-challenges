hey there, you must be pretty curious to have found this.
This challenge was originally thought up by nomad pather 
who thought of it with the help of iffy books.
there will be more of these boards around philadelphia
and if you have an idea of a challenging challenge that
can be written on one of these boards or if you have 
something else, feel free to email me at J.pather@protonmail.com
happy hacking!

also if u already know the answer to the puzzle, please
dont spoil it for others it doesnt help them learn thx 

also also if you want, figure out how to write to this
file and leave ur tag or whatever and explain how u did it.
